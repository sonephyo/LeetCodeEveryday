| 695              | Max Area of Island               | Medium            | Traverse through the matrix by modifying it if you have already encoutered and keep track. Recursion will stop while looping       |
| 26              | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array               | Easy            | Important to think what to use when the array is ordered      |
| 90              | Subsets II              | Medium            |       |
| -              | Ceiling of a Number             | Medium            |  Binary Search but modifying in a way that fits the need of the problem specification     |
|   378          | Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix              | Medium            |  See the pattern but don't forget the use cases of data structure     |
|   646          | Maximum Length of Pair Chain             | Medium            |  When to apply Greedy Algorithm - when local optimal solution leads to local maximum solution     |
